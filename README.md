### Background

The reason why I must step forward with this lengthy presentation is because initially I attempted to install a WooCommerce store in your website. It was impossible as your website hadn't been updated in years and therefore it was no longer compatible with the current version of WooCommerce. 

You cannot update your version of WordPress without destroying many parts of your website, believe me, I did this on a cloned version of your website and the results were not pretty!

I then attempted to roll back the version of WooCommerce to match the older version of your Website and although this method was successful, when I went to do it on the actual website, there was a warning alert and I was not prepared to overlook this without making sure you knew the risks and responsibilities involved. 

Therefore, the option presented to you by my colleague, Derek was for me to build a brand new site and rebuild, update and maintain your website moving forward. This would involve hosting, up to 3 small amendments a month. There is a premium cost for unlimited structural amendments available on request.   

### Before commencing a new build 

* It is essential that you understand that to replicate your website by hand is a big challenge and requires about 80 - 100 hours of work. I should also advise you that
[Leisure Theme](https://demo.curlythemes.com/hotel-wp/) is a very old template and it is not compatible with many of the latest plugins from WordPress.

* I would advise maintaining the information architecture as outlined in your [sitemap](https://octopus.do/kkgshwqy3xa) but [selecting a new theme](https://elements.envato.com/wordpress/hotel) from envato. An agreement between the strong solid information architecture of the old with the freshness of the new.

### Before commencing a new build II

* I do not want to commit to this volume of work in vain because I have a fiduciary responsibility to the hotel to make you aware of what is involved if you decide to run with me and Derek.  

### What you need to know about DNS: Migrating A Website (The super boring part)

* DNS is a router which sits behind your domain name https://rosspark.com 

* This DNS routes a database through a server to your URL; https://rosspark.com 

* There are many routes but the **three** you should be aware of are; 

1. NS record for your server 
2. A Record for your website 
3. MX Record for your email 

* There are several ways to set up a companies' DNS

* As of today, **your current hosting provider holds all three records** 

* What I am proposing is for **me to host all three records in The Cloud** 

* You can split up the DNS between hosting providers but I do not recommend this. 

* I have seen different types of errors as a result of split records.  

* It also means **paying double**. Lesley Stannage would still charge you for hosting NS and MX records and I would have to charge for A record hosting of website 

### Transferring Domain Ownership to You (With Me As Holder) 

* The domain name https://rosspark.com was purchased and is operated through the domain name registrant, TUSCOW'S INC. 

* **Lesley Stannage** or affiliates will have set this up. 

* I can put in a transfer request to the current registrar [TUSCOW'S INC](https://tucows.com/)

* But someone must go into that account on the other end and accept the transfer request for the domain name https://rosspark.com

* They then **MUST** provide me with the **authorization code** to complete the transfer 

* There are a number of resellers that operate under the umbrella of Tuscows Inc including, hover.com, OpenSRS.com, enom.com and ascio.com so **the account may be with any of these**

### What This Means 

* Once the domain name https://rosspark.com is transferred over it will have some **implications for your email**.

* Until I can reconfigure the DNS to point towards your new server in The Cloud, your emails will be offline as will the website

* This process can take between 1 - 5 Days. It honestly depends of how fast ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) processes the request

* I have personally experienced it within one hour but they warn it can take up to 5 days. 

* Furthermore, you must be prepared to abandon Outlook in favor of Google Workspace and there is a cost

* This would mean however, no more costs for your old email provider.  

![WorkspacePrices](https://res.cloudinary.com/chriskelly-it/image/upload/v1644665602/Screenshot_2022-02-12_at_12.32.31_wtyzdk.png)

* Google workspace is simple to use. Highly efficient, ubiquitous and available through mobile

* This means that info@rosspark.com would be accessed through Gmail as would all email addresses. Google charge per email

* This would mean that the hotel will be without any form of email communication until the new MX records are attached. 

* I understand speed is priority and would work hard with you to setup a new email account with Google Workspace and connect to my Google Account which would hold the Domain Name

* This will require work from both you, the hotel and me to get your new Gmail account set up and get your account details linked to The Cloud.

* Emails are important so this is a **major priority** for me when working with clients.  

### What This Means II

* This means that you would pay the cost of your emails **directly** to Google and pay me to host and maintain your website. 

### My Hosting Cost

* This is how much I charge for per month for [hosting in The Cloud](https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/cs_live_a1uWXLVJLBDhSnpcPVRoIeXspnBVCXNpNXvKPVMiaksJo8ASlRmrVLYW5c#fidkdWxOYHwnPyd1blppbHNgWjA0T1BSRzZJUWR8UDZTYV9nZkYycm5EaDIwYG5ISEdDdmtzZ3VENHw1R2xwTzRiY2BHUDJRcV9DTmNfT0ZKSFRCQGFmf2ZBMEtBaGdsb2I2PVExfUBURz1CNTVddXZ8VGBKdycpJ3VpbGtuQH11anZgYUxhJz8nZks3ZENSYVc2Z0hzM2gxYFBSJyknd2BjYHd3YHcnPydtcXF1dj8qKmZtd2x2bmBpaXwrbHEqJ3gl) 

### Moving Forward 
 
* If you find this acceptable, I will immediately initiate a domain transfer request which will alert [TUSCOW'S INC](https://tucows.com/) 

* A representative from Rosspark would need to inform Lesley Stannage that there is going to be a transfer request put in for the domain name https://rosspark.com 

* Lesley Stannage or whom ever initially bought the domain name should log in to their [TUSCOW'S INC](https://tucows.com/) account and accept the domain name transfer request for https://rosspark.com and provide me with the authorization code 

* You must **give me warning** before you do this because I have to put the transfer request in through Google Domains. 

* I want to assure you that if I am the registrant for https://rosspark.com I understand that it belongs to you. I will sign a contract and a release clause of Â£0.00 for the domain name should you ever choose to move forward to another company for website . 

* You should know that this will detach your emails until I can setup your new MX records with you and work with you to setup Gmail. 

* I need to remind you that this will not be Outlook. You would be moving forward to Google Workspace which has many other awesome feature if you have ever used Gmail.

### Summary 

Thank you for taking the time to read this presentation. I wish you a fantastic day and please contact me directly through Whattsapp on +34 603 766 507 optionally send me an email on chris@chriskelly.it or arrange a video meeting with me on my channel whereby.com/chriskelly.it

I want to let you know that the the value of the internet for a company is massive and these things, need to be done correctly. 

I have a good knowledge of what a good website should look like and feel like. I am an instructor of Web Design at the Barcelona Code School and I believe that the data and feedback that you can regain from a working, up to speed site will benefit the hotel and hopefully, you can finally get the Shop in your store that you wanted.

Chris
